# ci/cd pipeline project
build a continuous integration and continuous deployment for a simple web application by using devops tool.


## Tools and technologies
1. Git - Version control system.
2. Jenkins - Automation server for CI/CD.
3. Docker - Containerization platform.
4. Kubernetes - Container orchestration.
5. Ansible - Configuration management.
6. AWS/GCP/Azure - Cloud platform for deployment.
## steps to build the project
### Setup Git Repository:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Push a sample web application code (e.g., a simple Node.js or Java Spring Boot application and any other project) to the repository.

### Setup Jenkins:

Install Jenkins on your local machine or use a cloud-based Jenkins service.
Configure Jenkins to pull code from your GitHub repository.
Create a Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) to define your CI/CD pipeline.

### Dockerize the Application:

Write a Dockerfile for your application.
Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub or any other container registry.

### Deploy with Kubernetes:

1. Write Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files.
2. Use kubectl to apply these files and deploy your application to  a Kubernetes cluster.
3. You can use a local Kubernetes cluster like Minikube or a managed Kubernetes service from a cloud provider.

### Automate Configuration with Ansible:


Write Ansible playbooks to automate the setup of your infrastructure (e.g., installing Docker, setting up Kubernetes).
### Cloud Deployment:

If you are using a cloud provider, set up your infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters) on the cloud.
Use Ansible to configure the cloud infrastructure.
### Integrate Jenkins with Docker and Kubernetes:

Update your Jenkins pipeline to build the Docker image, push it to the registry, and deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster.
